        Our software monitors your investments to automatically trade similar
        assets that lose value, which can help you lower your tax bill while
        still keeping your portfolio on track. When you offset your capital
        gains by claiming many small losses, you can put the savings right back
        to work in the market. No tractors or shovels required.
